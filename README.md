# Luma Updater - Lua

This is a simple 3dsx updater for Luma3DS. It uses lpp-3ds in order to work.

## Usage

Usage is simple: copy the 3ds folder onto the root of your SD, then use the homebrew launcher.

If you use a custom path, edit /3ds/LumaUpdater/index.lua, and change the variable "a9lh_path" to your custom path (include the foward slash!)

This currently supports custom paths and path changing patch, and both hourlies and stable releases! In addition, it supports making and restoring backups of arm9loaderhax.bin!
